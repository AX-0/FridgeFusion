## Cheesy Steak Sandwich

### Ingredients:

- 300g steak (such as sirloin or ribeye)
- 4 slices of cheese (such as cheddar or Swiss)
- 4 bread rolls
- 2 tablespoons of butter
- Salt and pepper (to taste)

### Instructions:

1. Start by preheating a grill or a frying pan over medium-high heat.
2. Season the steak with salt and pepper on both sides.
3. Cook the steak for 3-4 minutes per side, or until desired level of doneness is reached. Remove from heat and let it rest for a few minutes.
4. While the steak is resting, slice the bread rolls in half horizontally and spread butter on the inside of each half.
5. Place the bread rolls on the grill or in a separate frying pan, buttered side down, and cook until lightly toasted.
6. Thinly slice the rested steak against the grain.
7. Once the bread rolls are toasted, place a slice of cheese on the bottom half of each roll.
8. Top the cheese with a generous portion of sliced steak, and then add another slice of cheese on top of the steak.
9. Place the top half of each bread roll on the sandwich, creating a complete sandwich.
10. Depending on your preference, you can either heat the sandwiches in the grill or pan for a few more minutes to melt the cheese or serve as is.
11. Serve the cheesy steak sandwiches warm and enjoy!

Note: Feel free to add any desired condiments or toppings such as mayonnaise, lettuce, tomatoes, or onions to personalize your sandwiches.
