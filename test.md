Unfortunately, based on the dietary requirements of being vegan and lactose-free, and the allergies to wheat and nuts, it is not possible to create a recipe using milk, bread, fried egg, and steak. Milk is derived from animals and therefore not suitable for a vegan diet. Steak is also derived from animals and not suitable for a vegan diet. Bread typically contains wheat, which is an allergen in this case. Additionally, the fried egg is not suitable for a vegan diet. I recommend considering alternative vegan and lactose-free ingredients in order to create a suitable recipe that adheres to these dietary restrictions.
