**Ingredients:**
- 1 steak (cooked and sliced)
- 1 fried egg
- 2 slices of bread
- Cheese slices (your choice)
- Butter or oil for cooking

**Instructions:**

1. Heat a skillet or grill pan over medium-high heat. Cook the steak to your desired level of doneness. Set aside and let it rest.
2. In the same pan, fry an egg until it reaches your desired doneness.
3. While the egg is cooking, spread butter on one side of each bread slice.
4. Place one bread slice, butter side down, in a separate skillet or griddle over medium heat.
5. Layer the steak slices on top of the bread slice in the skillet. Add cheese slices on top of the steak.
6. Once the cheese has melted, place the fried egg on top of the cheese.
7. Top with the second bread slice, butter side up.
8. Cook the sandwich on both sides until the bread is golden and crispy, and the cheese is fully melted.
