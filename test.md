Unfortunately, it is not possible to create a vegan and lactose-free recipe using the given ingredients of milk, bread, fried egg, and steak. The fried egg and steak contain animal products, and milk is also not suitable for a vegan diet. Additionally, bread typically contains wheat, which is not suitable for someone with a wheat allergy. However, here is an alternative recipe that is vegan, lactose-free, and free from wheat and nuts:

## Vegan Chia Pudding with Fruit and Toast

### Ingredients:
- 1 cup unsweetened almond milk (or any other plant-based milk)
- 2 tablespoons chia seeds
- 1 tablespoon maple syrup
- Assorted fruits (such as berries, sliced banana, or diced mango)
- Gluten-free bread (made with alternative flours like rice, oats, or quinoa)
- Coconut oil or dairy-free spread for toasting bread

### Instructions:
1. In a bowl, mix together the almond milk, chia seeds, and maple syrup. Stir well to combine. Let it sit for 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally until the mixture thickens and gels.
2. While waiting for the chia pudding to set, slice your choice of fruit and set them aside.
3. Toast the gluten-free bread using a toaster or a pan, spreading a small amount of coconut oil or dairy-free spread on both sides of the bread to keep it moist.
4. Once the chia pudding has reached a pudding-like consistency, divide it into serving bowls or jars.
5. Top the chia pudding with your choice of fruits.
6. Serve the chia pudding with the toasted gluten-free bread on the side.

Enjoy your vegan, lactose-free, wheat-free, and nut-free breakfast or snack!
